## 📖 Overview

This is my home cluster, built on [k8s](https://kubernetes.io), backed by [FluxCD](https://fluxcd.io/), [Terraform](https://terraform.io), [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/), and GitOps/DevOps principles. This is a place for me to learn, and share everything I've learned along the way. Feel free to ask questions, submit improvements, and learn from all the hard work I've put into this!

<!-- If you want to read about my adventures, I try to post about all my learning experiences on [my blog](https://blog.gitgud.sh). Come git gud with me! -->

## ⛵ Kubernetes

There's an excellent template over at [k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3](https://github.com/k8s-at-home/template-cluster-k3s) that I based my cluster on if you feel like following along :)

### Installation

My cluster is [k8s](https://kubernetes.io/) provisioned overtop bare-metal [Talos Linux](https://www.siderolabs.com/talos-linux), which is a bare-metal secure Kubernetes distro managed with IaC and the Talos CLI tool. This is a semi hyper-converged cluster, workloads and block storage are sharing the same available resources on my nodes while I have a separate server for (NFS) file storage.

### Core Components

- [actions-runner-controller](https://github.com/actions/actions-runner-controller): self-hosted Github runners
- [cilium](https://github.com/cilium/cilium): internal Kubernetes networking plugin
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/): creates SSL certificates for services in my cluster
- [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns): automatically syncs DNS records from my cluster ingresses to a DNS provider
- [external-secrets](https://github.com/external-secrets/external-secrets/): managed Kubernetes secrets using [1Password Connect](https://github.com/1Password/connect).
- [ingress-nginx](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/): ingress controller for Kubernetes using NGINX as a reverse proxy and load balancer
- [rook](https://github.com/rook/rook): distributed block storage for persistent storage
- [sops](https://toolkit.fluxcd.io/guides/mozilla-sops/): managed secrets for Kubernetes, Ansible, and Terraform which are committed to Git
<!-- - [spegel](https://github.com/XenitAB/spegel): stateless cluster local OCI registry mirror -->
- [tf-controller](https://github.com/weaveworks/tf-controller): additional Flux component used to run Terraform from within a Kubernetes cluster.
- [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync): backup and recovery of persistent volume claims

### GitOps

[Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) watches the clusters in my [kubernetes](./kubernetes/) folder (see Directories below) and makes the changes to my clusters based on the state of my Git repository.

The way Flux works for me here is it will recursively search the `kubernetes/${cluster}/apps` folder until it finds the most top level `kustomization.yaml` per directory and then apply all the resources listed in it. That aforementioned `kustomization.yaml` will generally only have a namespace resource and one or many Flux kustomizations (`ks.yaml`). Under the control of those Flux kustomizations there will be a `HelmRelease` or other resources related to the application which will be applied.

[Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate) watches my **entire** repository looking for dependency updates, when they are found a PR is automatically created. When some PRs are merged Flux applies the changes to my cluster.

### Directories

The Git repository contains the following directories under [cluster](./cluster/) and are ordered below by how [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) will apply them.

- **flux**: directory is the entrypoint to [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2).
<!-- - **crds**: directory contains custom resource definitions (CRDs) that need to exist globally in your cluster before anything else exists. -->
<!-- - **core**: directory (depends on **crds**) are important infrastructure applications (grouped by namespace) that should never be pruned by [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2). -->
- **apps**: directory (depends on **core**) is where your common applications (grouped by namespace) could be placed, [Flux](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2) will prune resources here if they are not tracked by Git anymore.
- **bootstrap**: directory contains bootstrap procedures for the cluster(s).
- **components**: directory contains re-useable components that can be used in the **apps** directory.

```sh
📁 bootstrap          # bootstrap procedures
📁 kubernetes
├── 📁 apps           # applications
├── 📁 flux           # core flux configuration
└── 📁 components     # re-useable components for gatus, volsync, other odds and ends
📁 talos              # talos IaC
├── 📁 clusterconfig  # where the config gets stores locally once generated for each host
└── 📁 patches        # patches for the config, things like my nvidia GPU patch
```

## ☁️ Cloud Dependencies

While most of my infrastructure and workloads are self-hosted I do rely upon the cloud for certain key parts of my setup. This saves me from having to worry about two things. (1) Dealing with chicken/egg scenarios and (2) services I critically need whether my cluster is online or not.

The alternative solution to these two problems would be to host a Kubernetes cluster in the cloud and deploy applications like [HCVault](https://www.vaultproject.io/), [Vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden), and [Gatus](https://gatus.io/). However, maintaining another cluster and monitoring another group of workloads is a lot more time and effort than I am willing to put in.

### Persistent Volume Data Backup and Recovery

I utilize [rook-ceph](https://github.com/rook/rook) for my persistent volume claims (PVCs) and have a backup and recovery solution in place using [volsync](https://github.com/backube/volsync), which backs up to an S3 bucket hosted by Backblaze B2.

## 🌐 DNS

### Ingress Controller

Over WAN, I have port forwarded ports `80` and `443` to the load balancer IP of my ingress controller that's running in my Kubernetes cluster.

[Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) works as a proxy to hide my homes WAN IP and also as a firewall. When not on my home network, all the traffic coming into my ingress controller on port `80` and `443` comes from Cloudflare.

🔸 _Cloudflare is also configured to GeoIP block all countries except a few I have whitelisted_

### Internal DNS

Handled by UniFi OS on my UniFi Dream Machine Pro.

### External DNS

[external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns) is deployed in my cluster and configure to sync DNS records to [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/). The only ingress this `external-dns` instance looks at to gather DNS records to put in `Cloudflare` are ones that have an ingress class name of `external` and contain an ingress annotation `external-dns.alpha.kubernetes.io/target`.

### Dynamic DNS

My home IP can change at any given time and in order to keep my WAN IP address up to date on Cloudflare I have deployed a [CronJob](./cluster/apps/networking/cloudflare-ddns) in my cluster. This periodically checks and updates the `A` record `ipv4.domain.tld`. I followed the example of [onedr0p/home-ops](https://github.com/onedr0p/home-ops/tree/main/cluster/apps/networking/cloudflare-ddns) as well as docs online. I'll probably write a blog post about it! `external-dns` is pure magic!

## ⚡ Network Attached Storage

Right now, I'm running my NAS off an old Dell PowerEdge R510 12 bay server. It's a little power hungry! I run TrueNAS, and have a RAIDz10 setup.

Currently, my raw storage capacity is about 56TB. However, I only get about half that since I'm doing RAIDz10. I have a striped set of 6 mirrored pairs. Effectively I can lose up to half my drives, but if I lose both drives in any pair, I'm having a bad day.

To offset this, I back up the NAS once a week to Backblaze B2 object storage, using a data protection setting in TrueNAS SCALE.

I'm slowly replacing all the 2TB drives, which came with my NAS, as they fail or I catch a sale on nicer WD Easy Store drives that I shuck. These are usually white label WD Red drives, or sometimes even better, HGST drives. My plan is to slowly upgrade everything to 12TB drives.

My NAS can be accessed via NFS/SMB/FTP over my home network.
